# Authentication

Conductor supports integrated authentication using the [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/) protocol.

By default, authentication is disabled. To enable it,

- Set the `auth` environment variable to `'true'`
- Set the `alg` environment variable to the signing algorithm (`RS256` or `ES256`)
- Set the `publickey` variable to a Base64 encoded public key.

If authentication is enabled then you need to include a signed [JWT bearer token](https://jwt.io/) along with every request. The is done by adding the `Authorization: Bearer <<token>>` header to each request.
The token should be a valid JWT token that was signed with the corresponding private key to the public one in the environment variable.

The token must also include a scope claim that indicate the level of access. The following scopes are used within Conductor.

- `conductor:admin` - Adminstrative tasks.
- `conductor:author` - Authoring of workflow definitions and steps.
- `conductor:controller` - Starting, stopping, suspending and resuming workflows.
- `conductor:viewer` - Querying the status of a workflow.
- `conductor:worker` - Activity workers.

A minimal JWT payload the include all the scopes would look as follows

```json
{
  "scope": "conductor:admin conductor:author conductor:controller conductor:viewer conductor:worker"
}
```
